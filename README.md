Library Management System
This is a simple library management system written in C language. It allows the user to perform the following operations:

1. Add a book to the library
2. Search for a book by title
3. Remove a book by ID
4. Display all books in the library
5. Exit

Enter the number corresponding to the operation you want to perform and follow the prompts on the screen.

Notes:
When searching for a book by title, the search is case-sensitive. 
When removing a book by ID, if multiple books have the same ID, only the first one found will be removed.
